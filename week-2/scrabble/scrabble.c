/* In the game of Scrabble, players create words to score points, and the number of points is the sum of the point values of each letter in the word.

0 Points - Blank tile.
1 Point - A, E, I, L, N, O, R, S, T and U.
2 Points - D and G.
3 Points - B, C, M and P.
4 Points - F, H, V, W and Y.
5 Points - K.
8 Points - J and X.
10 Points - Q and Z.

For example, if we wanted to score the word Code, we would note that in general Scrabble rules, the C is worth 3 points, the o is worth 1 point, the d is worth 2 points, and the e is worth 1 point. Summing these, we get that Code is worth 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7 points. */
