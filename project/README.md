# paramartor

The actual project is in the sub folder `/paramartor`. The folder `/learn-needed-tech` contains projects I did to learn the needed to tech to realize my final project.

"paramartor" is an invented word based on the idea of parametrized visual art generation.

A website that enables you to creatre artistic images by adjusting parameters used as variables by a prepared piece of code that generates the image.

(detailed description further below, after purpose, tech used, and instructions how to run the project locally to develop it further)

## purpose

The CS50x course finishes with a final project that leaves much room for creativity. Since I am interested in the intersaction of art and programming, I decided to explore this realm.

## tech used

-   the p5.js (https://p5js.org/) library to draw programmatically (a JavaScript version of Processing: https://www.processing.org/)
-   Nuxt.js (https://nuxtjs.org/), a JavaScript based web framework (similar to flask) relying on the Vue.js (https://vuejs.org/) JavaScript framework
-   Element UI (https://element.eleme.io/), which is similar to Bootstrap
-   Netlify (https://www.netlify.com/), a free online hosting platform

I chose p5.js because it seems to be the leading library for drawing geometric shapes in the browser.

The rest of the stack (Nuxt, Vue, Elemet UI) I chose because I will be working professionally with it soon in a new job.

## run the project locally

-   git clone (you need only the /paramartor directory)
-   npm run dev

## detailed functionality description

-   if you go to https://tinyurl.com/paramartor, you will be redirected to the website deployed on Netlify
-   the website's home page is also it's info (information) page. It starts with a short introduction and exemplifies what can be created with it, along with a mention of the p5.js library
-   on the bottom of the page, there's a short FAQ with potentially interesting questions a first time user might have
-   the website will automatically indicate the active page in the menu based on the user's entry point to the website, as well as further browsing on the website thereafter
-   the footer of the website features two links: contact and legal
-   the legal page contains a legal disclaimer, mostly auto-generated by https://www.termsfeed.com/
-   the contact page contains a simple contact form to be able to get in contact with me, the website's creator
-   the website will show a "back to top" button once scrolled over one view height down
-   finally, the most important page on the website is the create page
-   once opened, it will show a loading indicator until the HTML canvas with a first iteration of the image with default parameters is drawn
-   the main idea of the piece of code that is behind the image is to draw a circle in the middle of the canvas, then draw circles in four directions (up, down, left, right), with half the initial radius, and repeat this process recursively until the radius drops below a certain size
-   the website will automaticaly detect the width of the div in which the canvas is drawn, and it will automatically calculate the height of the canvas based on the width according to the golden ratio formula, and round both width and height down to the closest 10 integers. For example a viewer on a MacBook Air visiting the website using Google Chrome's default settings will end up with a width of 1160 pixels and a height of 720 pixels. This will automatically be set and is adjustable with number input fields. The automatically determined width will serve as the maximum width (and therefore, only be adjustable downwards), whereas the height is freely adjustable
-   the background color and stroke color can be changed using the color pickers
-   the innermost circle radius can be adjusted using a slider
-   it's possible to enable and disable drawing circles in each direction (up, down, left, right), which will re-draw the canvas
-   there is a reset button, which will re-initialize the canvas with default settings
-   finally, there's a download button that will open a prompt to save the image's current state
